Description
We found this weird message being passed around on the servers,
we think we have a working decryption scheme. Download the message here.
Take each number mod 37 and map it to the following character set: 0-25 is the alphabet (uppercase),
26-35 are the decimal digits, and 36 is an underscore.
Wrap your decrypted message in the picoCTF flag format (i.e. picoCTF{decrypted_message})
